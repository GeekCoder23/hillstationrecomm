    <div class="insight">An Insight into Shimla Tourism</div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>Among the most popular hill stations in India, <b>Shimla</b> holds a distinct place owing to its unique
            charm.
            Located at a distance of 342 km from the national capital, Delhi, Shimla is a great choice for a weekend
            getaway from Delhi and Chandigarh since there are so many places to visit in Shimla. Shimla is the capital
            city of Himachal Pradesh, and all it possesses and all it offers helps it easily justify its reputation and
            position as the capital city of a beautiful state, widely known for adventure activities and natural
            wonders. Laden with beautiful, dense forests of Pine, Oak, and Deodar, Shimla is refreshing in its very
            existence.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Shimla</b> houses some beautiful Hindu temples, located at apt locations, offering spectacular views of
            the
            beautiful hill station and the nearby hills with a thick covering of green forests. Some of the most revered
            temples in Shimla are Jakhoo Temple, Tara Devi Temple, Mansa Devi Temple, etc. These temples are located at
            short distances from the city center, so if you prefer, you can trek up to these temples through the woods.
            Shimla has a plethora of interesting places to visit and explore. As Shimla once served as the Summer
            Capital of British India, some captivating buildings with brilliant neo-Gothic architecture exist here.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Shimla</b> looks beautiful during all the seasons and can be visited during any time of the year. However, if
            you are interested in indulging in activities like camping, trekking and rafting in Shimla, the best time to
            visit is between March to June when the climate is pleasant. Most tourists visit Shimla during summer to
            find refuge in the cold hills of Shimla. But, visiting Shimla during winters is altogether a different
            experience. It is an ideal destination to spend a cold, lazy vacation at. If you get lucky, you may get to
            witness snowfall here between December to February, which is an experience, the memories of which you will
            always want to keep intact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Blessed with bounties of natural life, <b>Shimla</b> also finds a place in the itineraries of wildlife freaks, bird
            lovers and nature photographers. The 'Himalayan Bird Park', 'Kiala Forest' and 'Shimla Reserve Forest
            Sanctuary' are some of the popular wildlife spots in the region, and must visit attractions when in the
            city.
