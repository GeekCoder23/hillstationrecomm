    <div class="info">
        <p><b>Mcleodganj, Himachal Pradesh</b> is one of the most favorite tourist destinations of recent times. Because of
            being occupied by a lot many of Tibetans who moved here after China’s invasion of their homeland, Mcleodganj
            is also sometimes referred to as the Little Lhasa. It is also noteworthy the exiled government of Tibet is
            also based in Mcleodganj only.</p>
        <p>
            The town of <b>Mcleodganj, Himachal Pradesh</b> is famous especially and foremostly for being a spiritual getaway
            and pilgrimage for the Buddhists. The reason behind that is it is home to the 14th Dalai Lama of the
            Buddhists, Lama Tenzin Gyatso, who came here in the year of 1960 after his exile from Tibet. Dalai Lama
            established Tibet Government in exile here at Dharamshala and made the quaint little town of Mcleodganj as
            his permanent residence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The presence of His Holiness in town attracts a lot of tourists and pilgrims to the town. <b>Mcleodganj</b> is also
            one of the best places to see the real lifestyle of Tibetan Buddhists and monks from up close. One of the
            reasons this place is called Little Lhasa is because the people have built this place in the image of their
            previous abode. And it is possible to get a glimpse of the Dalai Lama on the occasions that he is in town
            and one of the many Buddhist festivals celebrated in the town.
        </p>
        <p>
            With such beauty, spirituality, adventure, and serenity, Mcleodganj is truly one of the best places to visit
            in the Himalayas. In fact, <b>Mcleodganj, Himachal Pradesh,</b> and many areas around it are experiences that
            should be visited at least once in a lifetime. So let the adventure unfurl as you take on the spellbinding
            journey through this amazing hill station of the Kangra District and in the lap of the Dhauladhar mountains.
