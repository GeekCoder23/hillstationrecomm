    <div class="insight">An Insight into Dalhousie Tourism</div>
    <div class="info">
        <p>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was won over by the beauty of <b>Dalhousie</b>,
            a famous tourist destination in Himachal Pradesh, so much so,
            that he stayed here for many months in 1937. Today, he has two places named after him
            - Subhash Baoli and Subhash Chowk. The hill station has the same effect on tourists today,
            with its waterfalls, rivers making their way through mountains, dense forest trails that run
            parallel to enormous cliffs with grand views of Dauladhar range in the distance and a couple
            of churches that were built during the British Raj. Cafes, markest, Mall Road, those are
            equally convincing reasons to plan a trip to Dalhousie.</p>
        <p>
            <b class="bold">Dalhousie</b> is one of the most famous hill stations of Himachal Pradesh. It stretches
            itself leisurely through
            the five mountains, Kathlog, Potreyn, Terah, Bakrota and Bhangora. It was established by Lord Dalhousie in
            1850, and there are many things that remind you of its colonial past. Sightseeing though, is one of the many
            ways of keeping yourself busy here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like most of the other famous hill stations in India, <b>Dalhousie</b> also boasts its own Mall Road.
            It is
            where most of the city’s socializing happens, and on any day, you can watch people taking a leisurely stroll
            or simply enjoying themselves by doing nothing. It’s a great place to interact with the locals, as well as
            lay your hands on Tibetan handicrafts, craftwork and woollen shawls.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Dalhousie</b> is also home to two temples, Bhulwani Mata and Bhalei Mata. Bhulwani Mata Temple is famous
            for a
            fair that is held every July. Bhalei Mata Temple also holds a historic significance, as it was built in the
            16th century by Raja Pratap Singh Varman.
